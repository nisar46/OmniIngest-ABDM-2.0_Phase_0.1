## ⚡ Executive Summary
**OmniIngest ABDM 2.0** is the architectural backbone for modern clinical data ingestion in India's federated health ecosystem. Designed as the **"Safety Rails"** for the next generation of AI-driven health apps (including "ChatGPT Health"), this system ensures that speed never compromises security.

It solves the critical "Last Mile" problem of interoperability: taking messy, unstructured legacy hospital data (CSV, PDF, HL7) and transforming it into **FHIR R5** compliant bundles, while strictly adhering to India's **DPDP Act 2023** (Digital Personal Data Protection Act).

## 💎 Critical Features

### 1. The "ChatGPT Health" Experience
Phase 0.1 introduces a radical shift in clinical UX. We moved away from sterile, grey enterprise dashboards to a **"Vibe-Coded"** interface:
- **Teal & Dark Mode**: Reduced eye strain for 24/7 clinical operations, inspired by premium GenAI tools.
- **Glassmorphism Metrics**: Real-time floating compliance cards.
- **Interactive "Sandbox Mode"**: One-click generation of 1000+ synthetic patient records for stress-testing.

### 2. Guardrails: The Rule 8.3 Kill Switch
Compliance is not a checkbox; it is code.
- **Cryptographic Shredding**: Implements a dedicated "Kill Switch" that overrides retention policies for immediate PII erasure.
- **Audit Lineage**: Even when data is purged, the *fact* of the purge is cryptographically logged in `audit_2026.json` with a unique Audit ID, ensuring regulatory transparency without retaining the sensitive data itself.
- **Visual Feedback**: The UI actively demonstrates the shredding process with a 3-step visible governance log.

### 3. Zero-Failure Smart Ingress
The `ingress.py` engine is built to never crash:
- **Universal Field Recovery**: If standard column mapping fails, the engine scans the entire file content using regex patterns to "rescue" critical identifiers like ABHA IDs.
- **Format Agnostic**: Seamlessly handles JSON, XML, XL7, FHIR, PDF, and deeply nested CSVs.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

| Component | Technology | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ingestion Engine** | `Polars` (Rust-based) | High-performance data cleaning & normalization. |
| **Logic Layer** | Python 3.10 | Business logic, Rule 8 enforcement. |
| **Compliance** | `fhir.resources` | Strict FHIR R5 schema validation. |
| **Interface** | `Streamlit` | Rapid, reactive UI/UX. |

## 📜 Regulatory alignment
This project is engineered to align with:
- **ABDM Standards**: Specifically the *Health Information Provider (HIP)* guidelines.
- **NRCeS**: Adopts the latest National Resource Centre for EHR Standards recommendations.
- **DPDP Act 2023**: Hard-coded strict adherence to Data Principal rights (Right to Erasure).
