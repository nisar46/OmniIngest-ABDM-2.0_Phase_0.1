# 🚀 Post Draft: OmniIngest Launch

**Headline:**
**Healthcare Data Ingestion is broken. It's time for the GenAI Standard.** 🧬

**Body:**
Think of it as **"The ChatGPT for Medical Data Ingestion"** — simply upload raw files, and the AI handles the rest.

For too long, integrating hospital data meant endless manual mapping, broken CSVs, and hours of debugging.

Today, I’m thrilled to introduce **OmniIngest: Phase 0.1** — a next-generation ingestion engine built for **ABDM 2.0** and the **DPDP Act**.

Unlike traditional tools that break when columns change, OmniIngest uses **"Bio-Digital" logic** to understand healthcare data contextually.

**🔥 Key Features:**
*   **🧠 Zero-Touch Ingestion**: Upload *any* messy Excel file. The AI auto-detects concepts (Patients, Lab Results, ABHA IDs) without manual templates.
*   **🛡️ Privacy-By-Design**: Automatic PII masking and "Quarantine" zones for non-compliant records.
*   **🇮🇳 ABDM 2.0 Ready**: Native support for India's digital health stack.
*   **⚡ The "GenAI" UI**: A dark-mode, futuristic interface that puts compliance metrics front and center.

**👇 Watch the 60-second demo below:**
See how it takes a raw, messy hospital export and turns it into a compliant FHIR dataset in seconds.

*Project built with Python and Streamlit.*
