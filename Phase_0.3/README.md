## ⚡ Executive Summary
**OmniIngest Phase 0.3** is the high-performance core of the **ORCHESTRA™** ecosystem. It is designed to solve the "Dark Data" crisis in global healthcare by transforming fragmented, unstructured clinical records into type-safe, **ABDM-compliant** streams. 

Built with a **Rust-based processing core**, Phase 0.3 moves beyond simple ingestion into **Agentic Orchestration**, serving as the foundational gateway for the upcoming **Universal Health Intelligence** platform.

## 🚀 The Evolution to ORCHESTRA™
Phase 0.3 marks the completion of the Ingestion Layer. We are now evolving into **ORCHESTRA™**, a multi-agent system that conducts clinical data across three major verticals:
1.  **Pharma MNCs**: Real-World Evidence (RWE) engines.
2.  **Insurance**: Automated Claims Integrity & Fraud Audit.
3.  **Hospitals**: The Clinical Reliability Shield (Zero-Error prescriptions).

## 💎 Phase 0.3 Key Technical Pillars

### 1. Rust-Accelerated "Dark Data" Rescue
Under the hood, OmniIngest uses **Polars** (Rust-based) for deterministic data normalization, achieving near C-level speeds when processing massive clinical legacy files (PDF, CSV, HL7, DICOM).

### 2. The Semantic Bridge
Phase 0.3 introduces the **Reasoning Layer prep**—ensuring every piece of ingested data is mapped to **HL7 FHIR R5** standards, making it "readable" by the next generation of Agentic RAG systems.

### 3. The DPDP "Kill Switch" (Rule 8.3)
Compliance is baked into the architecture:
- **Autonomous Shredding**: Immediate cryptographic erasure of PII.
- **Rule 8.3 Logging**: Real-time governance logs ensuring that Data Principal rights are respected natively in the code.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

| Component | Technology | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ingestion Engine** | `Polars` (Rust-based) | High-performance normalization. |
| **Persistence** | `SQLite` | Enterprise-grade state management. |
| **Compliance** | `fhir.resources` | Strict FHIR R5 schema validation. |
| **Orchestration** | `Agentic Gateway` | Semantic routing preparation. |

---

## 📜 Regulatory Alignment
- **ABDM 2.0**: Health Information Provider (HIP) compliance.
- **DPDP Act 2023**: Hard-coded strict adherence to Rule 8.3 (Right to Erasure).
- **Medical Law (IIT-KGP)**: Architecture verified against Bioethics and Regulatory standards.
