I am not your typical developer. I spent **5 years managing Hospital Operations** before writing a single line of code. I know exactly how data fails in the real world, and I build systems to fix it.

### 💬 Connect with a Domain Expert
I bridge the gap between **Doctors** (who hate bad software) and **Engineers** (who don't understand hospitals).

*   **Focus:** Digital Health Interoperability (Unified Health Interface)
*   **Mission:** Zero Data-Loss Governance.
