## 🛠️ Year 1: Starting with the Basics
In my first year at R K Nursing Home, the biggest problem was **human error**. 

- **The Problem**: Front desk staff often made typos in names or forgot ABHA IDs.
- **The Solution**: I didn't have fancy software, so I started writing simple Python scripts to find these errors.
- **The Code**: `src/Healthcare_Data_Analysis_Series/year_1_data_cleansing.py`

> "I believe that good healthcare starts with clean data. This project shows exactly how I started ensuring that."
